  <h1>Solvent Protocol - Financializing NFTs on Solana</h1>
</div>

Solvent is a protocol to convert the NFTs into a fixed number of fungible tokens of that collection.

- These fungible tokens a.k.a. droplets, are tradable on Serum orderbooks and AMMs across Solana
- 1 NFT --> 100 droplets --> 1 NFT
- Droplets are unique to each collection, and every NFT mints the same number of droplets of that collection.
- Droplets enables instant liquidity, and DeFi applications such as LPing, lending, and long/shorts to illiquid NFTs.
- Read our litepaper [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HwybfOLGkQ_HAo5zBl2Hf19yTnz4rtQH/view).
- NFT lockers is a functionality to mint depositor some droplets as a debt but locking that NFT so that it is not available in the open bucket. User can claim their locked NFTs by unlocking them and paying back the droplets debt + some interest within a duration. Failure to unlock the NFT within the duration specified results in locked NFT getting liquidated.

## Protocol functionality

These are the following functionality that the users can perform with the protocol:

- Create a bucket on Solvent for an NFT collection
- Mint 100 droplets by depositing the NFT into its suitable bucket
- Burn 100 droplets to claim an NFT from the bucket

### NFT Lockers

NFT lockers are vaults that users can use to lock their NFT for a certain duration **D** into Solvent and unlock instant liquidity for them. Within that duration, the users can pay back the debt and interest and can claim their NFT back. Users can select any duration up to a certain duration limit **Dmax**. The duration can be mentioned in the number of hours. If the users default to make the payment of debt and interest, they’re liquidated. If a user unlocks the NFT before they’re about to be liquidated, they only pay interest for the duration for which the NFT was locked. The interest that is paid is accumulated in an interest vault account.

The formula for droplets minted for an NFT that gets locked is shown as below:

The formula for the interest that the user ends up paying for unlocking the NFT is shown as below:
